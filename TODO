- don't create chats for every message sent
- after a message is sent, return the chatmessage ID to enable the broker ignore messages the bot sends itself
- fix the chat listener using skype message types. 
- improve logging, when an answer is sent print the message it is replying to.
- prevent the alias executor from overriding any commands the bot understands
- move the alias expander to expand before delivering to any executor, instead of expanding only inside the voting executor
